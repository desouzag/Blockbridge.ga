# www.blockbridge.ga

This repo hosts the code for blockbridge.ga on the main branch.

Changes to the documentation can be made on GitHub by editing files in the source folder. Please make sure that any changes you make are against develop. The idea is that we can merge recklessly to develop, then anyone see if the changes look OK on the merge.

main is protected and only ever gets changed when merging develop (git merge develop --ff). This method makes for easy maintenance AND allows a larger group of people to push directly to develop and show their changes on the staging site when asking for review, which should smooth out and speed up the process considerably for everyone.
